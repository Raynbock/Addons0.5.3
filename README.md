# Addons0.5.3
Addons for WoW version 0.5.3 made with Chatgpt.

Atlas:
Pretty much what you would expect, working like the most basic form of Atlas with loot.
"/atlas" to open.
You can link items in chat if you open the chat and "Shift+Lclick on the item Icon"
Leftclicking the Item will open another Item Tooltip incase you want to compare it.
Atlas Window is dragable.

Macro Bar:
2 additional Action Bars only usable for Macros.
If you want to add Macros or change the order, you need to do it in "Interface\FrameXML\MacroBar\MacroBar_Data.lua"
every character you play uses the standard Macro Bar. If you want character to have custom Bars, just change "NAMEONE"/"NAMETWO" in the Data file mentioned before to your characters name. if you need more, just copy paste the code.

Icon Browser:
Browse available Icons (like Item Icons) in game. Usefull for Macro Bar.
"/icons" to open the Window
Self explanatory when you see it. If you hover over an icon you can see its path name.
If you Lclick an item, you print the path in chat, in case you need it for something (Macrobar for example).
Has a search function.
Window is dragable, dragging will automatically bring you back to page 1 in case you were browsing.
